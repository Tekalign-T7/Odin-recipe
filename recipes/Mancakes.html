            Start Dad off with these sweet and savory <br>
            pancakes with the bacon built right in.<br>
            "Sweet/savory hybrids can be tricky sometimes<br>
            but I think this worked beautifully,<br>
            "says Chef John. "We are talking about bacon,<br>
            cheese, and onions after all,<br>
            so it wasn't that big of a shock. <br>
            The way the chipotle-spiced maple syrup brought<br>
            everything together was a risk well rewarded."<br>
